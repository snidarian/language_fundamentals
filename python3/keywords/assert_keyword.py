# the assert keyword is used to raise an assertion error and shutdown a program
# if a a certain criteria is not met

# example

# Create a string
string = "chrysanthamum"

# search for a substring within that string
# the substring "crh" is not in the word "chrysanthamum" so it raises and exception and shutsdown
assert "crh" in string
